So, I was chilling at a Denny's and eating some bacon.
Suddenly, the bacon started squirming. 
As I took another bite, I realized that I was actually standing on the ceiling.
A girl version of myself looked up at me from the ground.  
"What are you doing up there?" She asked.  
I walked to her through the fourth dimension.  
I tried to tell her I was eating bacon, but The Eye stole my words.  
She looked back to me mournfully.  
"I'm sorry it's come to this. I... I can't help you."
A red flash washed out my screams into the Void.
